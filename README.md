# Time_and_Math
This is not a traditional clock! it's a math clock..so first we give two commands python -m venv myenv   AND   myenv\scripts\activate. This happens so that we enter a clear virtual enivironment. Then we execute the program as always. There is a video on Issues folder. Voila a math clock!!!
